Learning Goals/Current Projects
A past project I worked on and completed was the Zipf Distribution Analyzer 
This project allowed for the user to upload any pdf of their choice, and then would analyze the word frequency distribution, graph it, and then compare it the ideal zipfs law and show how close they align

A current project I am working on is a totally-encompassing statistics app (MAYBE will call Stats_Hub)
It will be a tool that will be your one stop shop for all your statistics needs.
